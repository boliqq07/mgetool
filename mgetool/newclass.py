    called in the initialization of an instance of the new object and the
    returned instance is added as an attribute of the class' instance.
    Otherwise, if the argument is not a class, (for example an :class:`int`),
    it is added as a "static" attribute of the class.

    :param base: A base class from which to inherit.
    :param kwargs: One or more attributes or function to add on instantiation of this
                      class, optional.

    The following is used to create a class :class:`Foo` inheriting from the
    standard :class:`list` and having an attribute :attr:`bar` being an empty
    dictionary and a static attribute :attr:`spam` initialized to 1. ::

    module something like the following. ::
